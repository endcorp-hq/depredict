# Architecture & Technical Details

This page provides a detailed overview of the Depredict protocol's technical architecture and implementation.

---

## Protocol Overview

Depredict is built on Solana using the Anchor framework, with three main components:

1. **On-chain Program** (`programs/depredict/`): Rust smart contracts
2. **TypeScript SDK** (`sdk/`): Client library for protocol interaction
3. **Documentation** (`depredict-docs/`): Guides and API reference

---

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Accounts

#### Config Account
- **Purpose**: Protocol-wide configuration and fee management
- **Key Fields**:
  - `fee_amount`: Protocol fee in basis points
  - `authority`: Admin authority for config updates
  - `fee_vault`: Address to receive protocol fees
  - `next_market_id`: Auto-incrementing market ID

#### Market State Account
- **Purpose**: Individual market data and state
- **Key Fields**:
  - `market_id`: Unique market identifier
  - `question`: Market question (max 80 characters)
  - `market_start/end`: Market timing
  - `betting_start`: When trading begins (for future markets)
  - `oracle_type`: Switchboard or manual resolution
  - `market_type`: Live or future market
  - `yes_liquidity/no_liquidity`: Current liquidity pools
  - `pages_allocated`: Number of allocated position pages
  - `mint` and `decimals`: Token used for trading and its decimals
  - `market_vault`: Vault address holding market funds

#### Market Creator Account
- **Purpose**: Represents a platform/team that creates markets. Holds NFT collection and merkle tree references used for positions.
- **Key Fields**:
  - `name`: Display name of the market creator
  - `creator_fee_bps`: Creator fee in basis points (max capped in program)
  - `fee_vault`: Creator fee vault
  - `core_collection`: MPL Core collection used for position NFTs
  - `merkle_tree`: Bubblegum compression tree for scalable minting

#### Position Pages
- **Purpose**: Scalable, paged storage of positions per market to support high throughput.
- **Details**:
  - Each market has multiple `position_page` accounts, with fixed slots (e.g., 16 entries per page)
  - New pages are created on-demand and may be pre-warmed when capacity is low
  - SDK auto-discovers or creates a page with available slots when opening a position

#### Position NFT
- **Purpose**: Individual position representation
- **Implementation**: MPL Core NFT (compressed), minted at position open and burned at settlement
- **Key Fields**:
  - `position_id`: Unique position identifier
  - `direction`: YES or NO position
  - `amount`: Position size
  - `status`: OPEN, WAITING, SETTLED, etc.

### Account Relationships (Three-tier model)

- Protocol Tier: `Config` controls global parameters and the `next_market_id`.
- Market Creator Tier: `MarketCreator` is verified by linking an MPL Core `core_collection` and Bubblegum `merkle_tree` before creating markets.
- Markets/Users Tier: Each `MarketState` owns `PositionPage` accounts and a market `vault`. Users open positions that mint compressed NFTs under the creatorâ€™s collection/tree.

## Market Types

### Live Markets
- **Start**: Trading begins immediately when market is created
- **Use Case**: Real-time events, breaking news, etc.

### Future Markets
- **Start**: Trading begins at a specified future time
- **Use Case**: Scheduled events, elections, etc.

For broader categories like binary, multi-outcome, scalar, and tournament markets, see [Market Types](/market-types).

---

## Oracle Integration

### Switchboard Oracle
- **Usage**: Automated, decentralized resolution
- **Cost**: ~$0.15 per resolution
- **Setup**: Requires oracle pubkey during market creation

### Manual Resolution
- **Usage**: Admin-controlled resolution
- **Cost**: Gas fees only
- **Process**: Admin calls `resolveMarket` with outcome

---

## Instruction Flows

### Create Market
0. Precondition: The `market_creator` must be verified with a valid MPL Core collection and Bubblegum merkle tree
1. Derive PDAs for `config`, `market`, `position_page_0`, and `market_creator` (from payer)
2. Initialize market with question, timings, market type, oracle type, and mint/decimals
3. Allocate first position page

SDK: `client.trade.createMarket({ question, startTime, endTime, oracleType, marketType, bettingStartTime?, metadataUri, payer })`

### Open Position
1. Fetch market and its mint, market vault, and market creator
2. Find or create a position page with available slots
3. Mint a compressed MPL Core NFT representing the position
4. Transfer funds into the market vault

SDK: `client.trade.openPosition({ marketId, amount, direction, payer, metadataUri })`

### Resolve Market
1. If manual, pass resolution value; if oracle-driven, read Switchboard result
2. Update market state and winning direction

SDK: `client.trade.resolveMarket({ marketId, payer, resolutionValue? })`

### Settle Position (Payout)
1. Provide compressed NFT proof (root, hashes, nonce, index)
2. Single `settlePosition` instruction burns the cNFT and transfers winnings (if any) in the same path
3. Losing positions still execute the burn gate; payout resolves to zero so the transaction only consumes compute
4. All settlement flows use the same instruction, so batching winners and losers in one transaction is supported

SDK: `client.trade.payoutPosition({ marketId, payer, assetId, rpcEndpoint, returnMode? })`

### Close Market
1. Collect protocol and creator fees
2. Close market accounts and vaults

SDK: `client.trade.closeMarket(marketId, payer)`

---

## Token Integration

### Automatic Token Swapping (coming soon)
- **Planned**: Trade with any SPL token
- **Planned flow**: Convert user token to market mint via Jupiter aggregator
- **Current behavior**: Users must pay with the market mint; ensure the user's ATA for the market mint is funded

### Fee Structure
- **Protocol Fee**: Configurable percentage of trade volume
- **Oracle Fee**: Per-resolution cost for Switchboard markets
- **NFT Minting**: ~0.002 SOL per position

---

## Position Management

### NFT-Powered Positions
- **Technology**: MPL Core for NFT minting
- **Benefits**:
  - True ownership and transferability
  - Secondary market trading
  - Composability with other protocols

### Position Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: User opens position, NFT is minted
2. **Trading**: Position can be transferred or held
3. **Resolution**: Market outcome determines position value
4. **Settlement**: User claims payout by burning NFT

### Sub-Position Accounts
- **Purpose**: Handle multiple positions per user per market
- **Implementation**: Hierarchical account structure
- **Benefits**: Efficient storage and gas optimization

---

## Security Features

### Access Control
- **Config Authority**: Controls protocol parameters
- **Market Authority**: Controls individual market settings
- **Position Authority**: Controls individual positions

### Validation
- **Market State**: Prevents invalid state transitions
- **Timing**: Enforces market start/end times
- **Liquidity**: Ensures sufficient liquidity for trades

### Error Handling
- **Custom Errors**: Specific error types for different scenarios
- **Graceful Degradation**: Markets can be paused or closed
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Admin tools for emergency situations

---

## Performance Considerations

### Gas Optimization
- **PDA Usage**: Program-derived addresses for deterministic account creation

### Address Lookup Tables (LUTs)
- **Motivation**: Settling a position requires many accounts (market, position page, mint, Bubblegum programs, proof path). Reusing a LUT keeps the user claim to a single transaction even when proofs are large.
- **Two-tier Strategy**:
  - **Creator LUT**: Stores accounts shared by every market under a market creator (config, creator PDA, merkle tree, collection, program IDs). Created once and reused.
  - **Per-Market LUTs**: Store only market-specific PDAs (market state, market vault, position pages, additional proof nodes). Created alongside the market so rent deposits stay small and can be reclaimed when payouts finish.
- **Lifecycle**:
  1. Build or extend the creator LUT during market-creator setup.
  2. After `createMarket`, create/extend a market LUT supplying `creatorLookupTableAddress` so shared accounts are excluded.
  3. When fetching a proof for settlement, extend the market LUT with any new proof nodes before the user signs their claim.
  4. Once all positions settle, deactivate and close the market LUT to reclaim the rent deposit; repeat for the creator LUT when no markets remain.

```typescript
import { PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';
import DepredictClient, { buildV0Message } from '@endcorp/depredict';

const client = new DepredictClient(connection);

// 1. Ensure creator LUT (shared across every market this authority runs)
const creatorLut = await client.trade.ensureMarketCreatorLookupTable({
  authority: admin.publicKey,
  payer: admin.publicKey,
});
if (creatorLut.createTx) await sendTx(creatorLut.createTx, [admin]);
for (const tx of creatorLut.extendTxs) await sendTx(tx, [admin]);

// 2. Ensure market LUT right after createMarket
const marketLut = await client.trade.ensureMarketLookupTable({
  marketId,
  authority: admin.publicKey,
  payer: admin.publicKey,
  creatorLookupTableAddress: creatorLut.lookupTableAddress,
  pageIndexes: [0, 1], // prewarm the first two pages
});
if (marketLut.createTx) await sendTx(marketLut.createTx, [admin]);
for (const tx of marketLut.extendTxs) await sendTx(tx, [admin]);

// 3. Before a user settles, extend the market LUT with new proof nodes (if any)
await client.trade.extendMarketLookupTable({
  marketId,
  authority: admin.publicKey,
  lookupTableAddress: marketLut.lookupTableAddress,
  creatorLookupTableAddress: creatorLut.lookupTableAddress,
  proofNodes: proof.proof, // strings or PublicKeys
});

// 4. Build the settle instruction; combine both LUTs in the final transaction
const { instruction } = await client.trade.buildSettleInstructionWithProof({
  marketId,
  claimer: user.publicKey,
  assetId,
  pageIndex: proofPageIndex,
  slotIndex: proofSlotIndex,
  proof: {
    root: proof.root,
    dataHash: proof.dataHash,
    creatorHash: proof.creatorHash,
    nonce: proof.nonce,
    leafIndex: proof.index,
    proofNodes: proof.proof,
  },
});
const { message } = await buildV0Message(
  client.program,
  [instruction],
  user.publicKey,
  [creatorLut.lookupTableAddress.toBase58(), marketLut.lookupTableAddress.toBase58()],
);
await sendVersioned(message, [user]);

// 5. After payouts complete
const { deactivateTx, closeTx } = await client.trade.buildMarketLookupTableCloseTxs({
  authority: admin.publicKey,
  lookupTableAddress: marketLut.lookupTableAddress,
});
await sendTx(deactivateTx, [admin]);
await waitOneSlot();
await sendTx(closeTx, [admin]); // rent reclaimed
```

- **Costs**: A typical market LUT (~20 addresses) locks &lt;0.0005 SOL rent, fully refunded upon close. The creator LUT deposit (~15â€“20 addresses) is paid once and can be recovered when the creator retires the table. Transaction fees for create/extend/deactivate/close are a few thousand lamports each.
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple operations in single transaction
- **Account Reuse**: Efficient account structure design

### Scalability
- **Parallel Processing**: Solana's concurrent transaction processing
- **State Management**: Efficient account state updates
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized data structures
