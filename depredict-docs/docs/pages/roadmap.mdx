# Roadmap

Depredict is committed to building the most open, scalable, and innovative prediction market protocol on Solana. Here's a transparent look at our current architecture, challenges, and where we're headed next.

## NFT-Powered Markets with MPL Core

We use [MPL Core](https://www.metaplex.com/core) to represent all markets and positions as immutable NFTs. This design ensures every market and position is:
- **On-chain and verifiable**
- **Transferable and composable**
- **Immutable and censorship-resistant**

**Challenge:** Each NFT costs about 0.002 SOL (roughly $0.30 at the time of writing). This is a significant cost for high-frequency or micro markets.

## Oracle Resolution with Switchboard

We leverage [Switchboard](https://switchboard.xyz/) for decentralized, trustless market resolution. This enables:
- Automated, on-chain outcome resolution
- Support for a wide range of data feeds

**Challenge:** Each oracle resolution costs about $0.15. For example, running an hourly market on the weather in one location would cost ~$100/month (24 x 30 x $0.15). This limits the viability of high-frequency, low-stakes markets.

## Exploring New Storage & Cost Solutions

We are actively researching new solutions to reduce costs and increase scalability. One promising direction is [Tapedrive](https://tapedrive.io/), a Solana-native decentralized storage network. Tapedrive could enable:
- Cheaper, scalable on-chain storage for market and position data
- New models for market creation and settlement

We're excited to experiment with these technologies and invite the community to share ideas or collaborate.

## Governance & Community

Depredict is currently **centralized** to help shape the protocol and iterate quickly. However:
- The project is fully open sourceâ€”anyone can fork, build, or contribute
- We are committed to gradually decentralizing governance as the community grows and traction builds
- Feedback, proposals, and pull requests are always welcome

## Get Involved

- Try the protocol and SDK
- Suggest improvements or new features
- Join the discussion on governance and protocol direction
- Contribute code or integrations

Depredict's future is open. Help us build the next generation of decentralized prediction markets on Solana!
