# Market Types

This page outlines common market structures you can build using Depredict.

---

## Binary (YES/NO)
- **Description**: Two-outcome markets, the default protocol primitive
- **Examples**: Will SOL close above $200 today?
- **Notes**: Highest liquidity and simplest UX

## Multi-Outcome (coming soon)
- **Description**: More than two outcomes (e.g., A/B/C)
- **Examples**: Who will win the tournament? Team A, Team B, Team C
- **Status**: Roadmap item; can be composed by multiple binary markets today

## Scalar (coming soon)
- **Description**: Continuous outcomes within a range
- **Examples**: What will BTC price be at expiry?
- **Status**: Roadmap item; can be approximated using bands or discrete binaries

## Tournament/Bracket (coming soon)
- **Description**: Hierarchical markets where outcomes depend on earlier rounds
- **Examples**: March Madness style brackets
- **Status**: Roadmap item; compose using multiple markets and off-chain orchestration

### Live Markets
- Start trading immediately upon creation
- Use for real-time or ongoing events

### Future Markets
- Trading opens at `bettingStartTime`, before `marketStart`
- Use for scheduled events such as elections or sports matches
