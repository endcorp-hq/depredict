# Development Environment Setup

How to set up a local development environment for Depredict.

---

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and Yarn
- Anchor CLI
- Solana CLI

---

## Localnet

```bash
# From repo root
anchor build

# Run tests sequentially until completion
anchor run test-runner-continue

# (Optional) deploy to localnet
anchor deploy
```

SDK build:

```bash
cd sdk
yarn install
yarn build
```

Docs site:

```bash
cd depredict-docs
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## IDs and Keys
- `tests/keys/` contains localnet testing keypairs
- `target/idl/depredict.json` provides the IDL used by the SDK
- Use `sdk/src/types/depredict-devnet.json` for devnet

---

## Tips
- Run individual tests with `anchor run <testname>` if needed
- Use `tests/setup-localnet.sh` for local validator orchestration
- For Switchboard and MPL Core, use the provided `.so` artifacts in `tests/`
