# Depredict Protocol Overview

Depredict is **THE decentralized prediction market protocol on Solana**.

We empower anyone to create, trade, and resolve prediction markets on any event, all on-chain, with unmatched speed and transparency. Built with NFT-powered positions and MPL Core, Depredict offers a truly decentralized and composable prediction market experience.

## What is Depredict?

Depredict is a fully on-chain protocol that enables users to:
- Create markets on real-world or crypto events
- Trade YES/NO positions in open markets
- Resolve outcomes in a trustless, transparent way

All market logic, settlement, and payouts are enforced by smart contractsâ€”no intermediaries, no custodians, no limits.

---

## Why Depredict?

- **Truly Decentralized:** All market operations are on-chain, censorship-resistant, and permissionless.
- **Solana Speed & Scale:** Built on Solana for lightning-fast transactions and low fees, even at high volume.
- **Open & Composable:** Integrate prediction markets into any app, bot, or dApp using our open SDK.
- **Transparent & Fair:** Outcomes, trades, and liquidity are visible and verifiable by anyone.
- **Community-Driven:** Anyone can create new markets, propose outcomes, and participate in governance.

---

## Core Features

- **Market Creation:** Launch new markets on any topic, from sports to crypto to world events.
- **NFT-Powered Positions:** Positions are represented as NFTs using MPL Core and compressed primitives for scale.
- **Scalable Position Pages:** Paged storage for positions enables high throughput markets with pre-warming for next pages.
- **Trading:** Buy and sell YES/NO positions instantly; pay using the market mint (no auto-swap yet).
- **Resolution:** Settle markets based on real outcomes with manual or Switchboard oracle-based resolution.
- **SDK & API:** Typed TypeScript SDK with modules for trade, position, config, and market creator operations.
- **Open Data:** All market and trade data is public and queryable.

## What's New in the SDK

The latest SDK unlocks better ergonomics, scalability, and admin tooling.

- **Modules**
  - **trade**: create/update/resolve/close markets; open positions; payouts
  - **position**: page management (ensure, prune, close), auto-find available slot/page
  - **config**: protocol config lifecycle and updates
  - **marketCreator**: create/verify/update market creators (name, fees, merkle tree)

- **Highlights**
  - `getMarketsByAuthority(authority)` to query your platform's markets
  - `createMarket({...})` supports `LIVE` and `FUTURE` markets with optional `bettingStartTime`
  - Position pagination via `position.findAvailablePageForMarket(...)` with automatic page creation
  - Admin flows: `updateMarket(...)`, `closeMarket(...)`, `resolveMarket(...)`
  - Payout flow with NFT proof verification: `payoutPosition({ marketId, payer, assetId, rpcEndpoint?, returnMode? })`
  - Market creator lifecycle: `createMarketCreator`, `verifyMarketCreator`, `updateCreatorFee`, `updateCreatorFeeVault`, `updateMerkleTree`

### Quick SDK Glance

```typescript
import { Connection, PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';
import DepredictClient, { MarketType, OracleType } from '@endcorp/depredict';

const connection = new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com');
const adminKey = new PublicKey('...');
const feeVault = new PublicKey('...');
const client = new DepredictClient(connection, adminKey, feeVault);

// Query your markets
const myMarkets = await client.trade.getMarketsByAuthority(adminKey);

// Create a LIVE market
const { tx, marketId } = await client.trade.createMarket({
  startTime: Math.floor(Date.now()/1000),
  endTime: Math.floor(Date.now()/1000) + 86400,
  question: 'Will SOL close above $200 today?',
  oracleType: OracleType.MANUAL,
  marketType: MarketType.LIVE,
  metadataUri: 'https://example.com/metadata.json',
  payer: adminKey,
});

// Open a YES position
await client.trade.openPosition({
  marketId,
  amount: 25,
  direction: { yes: {} },
  token: 'USDC_MINT',
  payer: adminKey,
  metadataUri: 'https://example.com/nft.json',
});
```
